# Request Structure

An MTConnect® request SHOULD NOT include any body in the HTTP
request. If the Agent 378 receives any additional data, the Agent
MAY ignore it. There will be no cookies or additional
information considered; the only information the Agent MUST
consider is the URI in the HTTP GET (Type a URI into the
browser’s address bar, hit return, and a GET is sent to the
server. In fact, with MTConnect® one can do just that. To
test the Agent, one can type the Agent’s URI into the browser’s address
bar and view the results.)
